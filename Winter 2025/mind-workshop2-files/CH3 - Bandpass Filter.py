# convert from Digital Value of Analog Digital converter (ADC) ADS1299 to microvolts

"""
converts raw EEG data from a 24-bit ADC (ranging from 0 to 16777215) into microvolts by normalizing the data,
scaling it to a 4.5V reference voltage, and converting to microvolts,
then rounding to two decimal places. This transformation is necessary for accurately interpreting EEG signals, which are typically measured in microvolts
